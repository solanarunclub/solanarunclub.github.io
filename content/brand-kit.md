Solana Run Club is a global community of runners united by the Solana ecosystem.

## Principles

- **Runners first**
- **Locally independent**
- **Tech inclusive**

### üèÉ Runners first

Run clubs can exist without sponsors, partners, or commercial interests. They cannot exist without runners.

Whatever local chapters do, they should always put runners first. This means prioritising the needs and interests of runners over commercial partnerships or sponsorships.

### üèòÔ∏è Locally independent

Each chapter is independent, and makes their own decisions about the events, activities and partnerships. However, as a global community, we share a common visual identity to create a cohesive global brand, and help local chapters attract runners, sponsors and partners.

### ü§ó Tech inclusive

While Solana is our conviction, we welcome runners from all backgrounds and ecosystems. Tech founders, AI enthusiasts, BTC and ETH maxis, TradFi professionals, web3 degens, are all welcome to join our runs.

## Naming

Strive to use _Solana Run Club_ in all communications. This name is clear, descriptive, and aligns with our mission to bring together Solana community members through running.

Our handle is `@solanarunclub` on all platforms, including [Telegram](https://t.me/solanarunclub), [X](https://x.com/solanarunclub), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/solanarunclub), [Luma](https://lu.ma/solanarunclub), [Strava](http://strava.com/clubs/solanarunclub). Use this handle consistently to build recognition.

Regional chapters can use the same handle with a location suffix.

## Colors

Our club uses Solana's primary colors to create a consistent visual identity:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">

{{< color-box color="#9945FF" textColor="#FFFFFF" >}}

{{< color-box color="#14F195" textColor="#000000" >}}

</div>

- **Purple (#9945FF)**: Primary brand color, often used as a background
- **Green (#14F195)**: Secondary accent color

## Images

All visuals are customisable on Canva. Open the templates on Canva, click File > Make a Copy, and edit them to your liking (requires a Canva account).
