Solana Run Club aims to bring together Solana community through regular running events. 

## Venue

For Europe, best venues are central city parks accessible by public transport and suitable for large groups.

Current locations:

- London: Hyde Park

## Route



- Start/end point = same
- Simple route (circle/square)

## Time

To account for commuters and varying schedules, recommended start times are:

- Weekday evenings (around 6:30pm)
- Weekend mornings (around 10am)

Weekly or biweekly runs are ideal.

## Partnerships

Run clubs rely on volunteers and require little funding. However, should you want to enhance the experience or cover specific costs (like merch, picnics, refreshments), you may rely on partners.
