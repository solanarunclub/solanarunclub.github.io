+++

Solana Run Club brings together Solana community through regular running events. Our format is 5K runs at conversational pace, followed by socialising and coffee.

Our goal is to create a global community branded as Solana Run Club represented by local chapters in different cities. This playbook is a guide for anyone who wants to start a local chapter of Solana Run Club.

This opportunity to lead a local Solana Run Club is ideal for:

- Active runners and Solana community members
- Community builders driven by the desire to connect people
- Networkers, whether new or experienced

# Logistics

## Venue

For Europe, best venues are central city parks accessible by public transport and suitable for large groups.

Current locations:

- London: Hyde Park: offers a large, flat area, good transport links and amenities around Marble Arch

## Route

From my experience, the best route should follow these guidelines:

- Start and end point are the same. Some participants may leave their bicycle at the start, so it is more convenient to return to the same place
- The route should be simple and easy to follow, ideally a circle or a square, so that you or participants can easily follow it without checking the map frequently
- Aim to avoid roads, narrow paths, and other obstacles

Keep the route around 5 km, ideally a little longer so that attendees can feel a sense of achievement.

> I highly recommend sharing live location with the group via Telegram or Google Maps. Telegram is preferred as multiple people can share their location at the same time, and it is easier to follow. Additionally, Google Maps appears to update location less frequently, which can lead to confusion.

## Time

To account for commuters and varying schedules, recommended start times are:

- Weekday evenings (around 6:30pm)
- Weekend mornings (around 10am)

Weekly or biweekly runs are ideal.

# Promotion

As you're starting a new run club, you'll need to promote it to attract participants. Here are some strategies.

## Event Platforms

Apart from local players in your region, two most important platforms to promote your run club are:

- [Luma](http://lu.ma): 100% free, beautifully designed, and popular among web3 folk. Recommended for all events.
- [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com): massive platform with a lot of users, but not as popular among web3 people, and costs $200/year to manage a page. It's good if you want to reach a wider audience, and attract people into the Solana ecosystem. Alex (alwye) has a Meetup page, so you can use it to promote your events.

## Partnerships

Your local **Superteam** is the go-to partner to help amplify your message on X, Telegram and IRL. They can offer feedback about the event, and may event offer financial support for food and drinks through the [Superteam Meetup Fund](https://earn.superteam.fun/grants/superteam-meetup-fund).

As you're launching a new run club, you can also reach out to us to help promote your first events.

# Partnerships

Solana Run Club relies on volunteers and requires little funding. However, should you want to enhance the experience or cover specific costs (like merch, picnics, refreshments), you can turn to partners.

Here are the partners we already working with:

- **SNS**: .sol domain giveaways for participants
- **SuperteamUK**: promotional and financial support
- **Moonwalk**: sponsor in-app games with USDC rewards
- **LootGO**: offer x1.2 in-app multiplier with a promo code

Consider regional players in the Solana ecosystem. As an example, [Flojo](https://drinkflojo.com) really loved the idea of a run club, though they don't have presence in Europe - they are primarily Canada-based.

Keep in mind that the more our run club expands, the more attractive it becomes to sponsors. At the same time, the more partnerships we have, the easier it is to attract new sponsors.

It's important to keep the experience engaging and to keep the community's best interests in mind, so be selective about partnerships and sponsorships.
